# Personal Website

My personal site at [adityaaswani.com](https://adityaaswani.com). 

It's a simple static site built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and the [Abridge](https://github.com/jieiku/abridge) theme. Contains info about my projects, meditation teaching, and ways to get in touch. Nothing fancy, just what I needed.

The site includes pages for my software projects (Pause Pal, Caliro), meditation guidance offerings, and contact information. Uses a dove favicon and has both light and dark themes.

Built to load fast and work on all devices.
