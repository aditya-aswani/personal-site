# Developer CLI Tool

A comprehensive command-line interface that empowers developers to streamline their workflows, automate repetitive tasks, and boost productivity. Built with Python and designed to be the swiss army knife of development tools.

## Overview

This CLI tool was born from the daily friction points I encountered as a developer. Instead of writing the same scripts over and over, I created a unified tool that handles project initialization, git workflows, environment management, and much more.

### Key Features

**ðŸš€ Project Scaffolding**
- Generate project templates for various frameworks
- Initialize git repositories with sensible defaults
- Set up CI/CD workflows automatically

**ðŸ”§ Workflow Automation**
- Automated git workflows (feature branches, releases)
- Environment variable management
- Database migration helpers

**ðŸ“Š Development Insights**
- Code metrics and analysis
- Git statistics and contributor insights
- Project health monitoring

**ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful Output**
- Rich terminal output with colors and formatting
- Progress bars for long-running operations
- Interactive prompts and menus

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The tool is built with a modular architecture that makes it easy to extend and maintain:

```
dev-cli-tool/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Core functionality and utilities
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/       # Individual command implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/      # Project templates and scaffolding
â”œâ”€â”€ integrations/   # Third-party service integrations
â””â”€â”€ tests/          # Comprehensive test suite
```

### Command Structure
Commands are organized into logical groups:
- **Project**: `init`, `scaffold`, `setup`
- **Git**: `branch`, `release`, `stats`
- **Environment**: `env`, `config`, `secrets`
- **Analysis**: `metrics`, `health`, `deps`

### Performance & Reliability
- **Async Operations**: Uses asyncio for concurrent tasks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery and user feedback
- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration system with sensible defaults
- **Testing**: 95%+ test coverage with unit and integration tests

## Command Examples

### Project Initialization
```bash
# Create a new React project with TypeScript
dev-cli init react-app my-project --typescript --tailwind

# Initialize with git, CI/CD, and deploy setup
dev-cli init fullstack-app --git --ci --deploy=vercel
```

### Git Workflow Automation
```bash
# Create feature branch and set up tracking
dev-cli git feature new-authentication

# Automated release workflow
dev-cli git release --version=1.2.0 --changelog

# Git repository analysis
dev-cli git stats --contributors --activity
```

### Environment Management
```bash
# Manage environment variables across environments
dev-cli env set DATABASE_URL --env=production

# Sync environment variables with team
dev-cli env sync --from=.env.example
```

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Managing complex command hierarchies and options
**Solution**: Used Click framework with custom decorators for consistent command structure

**Challenge**: Providing rich terminal output across different platforms
**Solution**: Leveraged Rich library for cross-platform terminal formatting

**Challenge**: Handling long-running operations gracefully
**Solution**: Implemented async operations with progress feedback and cancellation support

## Technologies Used

- **Core**: Python 3.8+ with Click framework
- **UI**: Rich for beautiful terminal output
- **Async**: AsyncIO for concurrent operations
- **Git Integration**: GitPython for repository operations
- **Configuration**: YAML/TOML support with validation
- **Testing**: Pytest with comprehensive fixtures
- **Distribution**: PyPI with automated releases
- **Documentation**: Sphinx with automatic API generation

## Installation & Usage

### Quick Installation
```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install dev-cli-tool

# Or install development version
pip install git+https://github.com/aditya-aswani/dev-cli-tool.git
```

### Getting Started
```bash
# See all available commands
