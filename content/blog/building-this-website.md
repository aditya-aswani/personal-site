# Building This Website: A Journey with Zola and Modern Web Technologies

When I decided to rebuild my personal website, I wanted something that would be fast, maintainable, and showcase modern web development practices. After evaluating various options, I landed on Zola with the Abridge themeâ€”a decision that proved to be excellent for performance and developer experience.

## Why I Chose Zola

Static site generators have come a long way, and the ecosystem offers many excellent options. Here's why Zola stood out for me:

### Performance First
Zola is built in Rust, which means it's incredibly fast. The build times are lightning quick, even for large sites, and the generated output is optimized for performance out of the box.

### Simple Yet Powerful
Unlike some other static site generators that can become complex quickly, Zola strikes a perfect balance. It's powerful enough for sophisticated sites but simple enough that you don't need to fight the framework.

### Modern Web Standards
Zola embraces modern web standards and generates clean, semantic HTML. This was important to me as someone who cares about web accessibility and SEO.

## The Abridge Theme: Performance Meets Aesthetics

Choosing the right theme was crucial. The Abridge theme caught my attention because of its focus on performance and modern design principles.

### Key Features That Sold Me

**âš¡ Lighthouse Perfect Scores**  
The theme consistently achieves perfect Lighthouse scores across all metricsâ€”performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

**ðŸŽ¨ Clean, Semantic HTML**  
The generated markup is clean and semantic, making it accessible and SEO-friendly without sacrificing design flexibility.

**ðŸ”§ No Mandatory JavaScript**  
Everything works perfectly even with JavaScript disabled, though optional JavaScript enhances the experience with features like search and theme switching.

**ðŸ“± Mobile-First Design**  
Responsive design that works beautifully across all device sizes, with touch-friendly interactions and optimized loading.

## Technical Implementation

Let me walk you through some of the key technical decisions and implementations that make this site performant and maintainable.

### Site Architecture

```
adityaaswani.com/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.toml          # Site configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ content/             # Markdown content
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _index.md       # Homepage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ about.md        # About page
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/           # Blog posts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ projects/       # Project portfolio
â”œâ”€â”€ sass/               # Custom styling
â”œâ”€â”€ static/             # Static assets
â””â”€â”€ templates/          # Custom templates (if needed)
```

### Configuration Highlights

The site configuration focuses on performance and user experience:

```toml
# Performance optimizations
compile_sass = true
minify_html = true
build_search_index = true

# SEO and social features
generate_feeds = true
[extra]
social_media_card = true
```

### Custom Styling

While the Abridge theme provides excellent defaults, I added custom styling to make the site uniquely mine:

```scss
// Custom color scheme
:root {
  --color-primary: #2563eb;
  --color-accent: #7c3aed;
  --color-text: #1f2937;
}

// Enhanced code blocks
pre {
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 6px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

Performance was a key priority throughout the development process. Here are some of the optimizations implemented:

### Image Optimization
- WebP format with fallbacks for older browsers
- Responsive image sizing based on viewport
- Lazy loading for images below the fold

### CSS Strategy
- Critical CSS inlined for faster initial render
- Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously
- SCSS compilation with autoprefixing

### JavaScript Approach
- Progressive enhancement philosophy
- Optional JavaScript for enhanced features
- Minimal bundle sizes with tree shaking

### Lighthouse Results
The optimizations paid off with excellent Lighthouse scores:
- **Performance**: 100/100
- **Accessibility**: 100/100
- **Best Practices**: 100/100
- **SEO**: 100/100

## Content Strategy

The site architecture supports multiple content types while maintaining simplicity:

### Homepage
A welcoming introduction that clearly communicates who I am and what I do, with clear calls-to-action to explore further.

### About Page
Detailed background information that tells my story and showcases my expertise and personality.

### Project Portfolio
Comprehensive project showcases with technical details, challenges, and solutions.

### Blog
Regular content covering technical topics, project insights, and industry thoughts.

## Deployment and Hosting

The site is hosted on modern cloud infrastructure with these considerations:

### Static Hosting
- Fast global CDN distribution
- Automatic HTTPS with modern TLS
- Excellent uptime and reliability

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated builds on content changes
- Deploy previews for testing
- Performance monitoring and alerts

### Domain and DNS
- Custom domain with proper DNS configuration
- Performance optimized DNS resolution
- Security headers and policies

## Lessons Learned

Building this site taught me several valuable lessons:

### Simplicity Wins
Starting with a solid foundation (Zola + Abridge) and building incrementally proved much more effective than trying to build everything from scratch.

### Performance Budget
Setting a performance budget early and sticking to it ensures the site remains fast as content grows.

### Content-First Approach
Focusing on content structure and user experience before visual design leads to better outcomes.

### Progressive Enhancement
Building features that work without JavaScript and then enhancing them creates a more robust user experience.

## Future Enhancements

While the current site meets all my goals, I have plans for future improvements:

### Interactive Features
- Comment system for blog posts
- Newsletter subscription
- Contact form enhancements

### Content Expansion
- Video tutorials and screencasts
- Podcast integration
- Case study deep-dives

### Technical Improvements
- Advanced analytics implementation
- A/B testing for content optimization
- Enhanced accessibility features

## Conclusion

Building this website with Zola and the Abridge theme has been an excellent experience. The combination provides the perfect balance of performance, maintainability, and flexibility that I was looking for.

The static site approach offers benefits that are hard to ignore:
- **Lightning-fast loading times**
- **Excellent SEO performance**
- **Simple deployment and hosting**
- **Outstanding security**
- **Low maintenance overhead**

For anyone considering a similar approach for their personal site or blog, I highly recommend exploring Zola and the Abridge theme. The learning curve is gentle, the documentation is excellent, and the results speak for themselves.
