I'm Aditya and I made this website to have one place that connects all the different things I'm working on. Here's what they are:

## Projects

- **Pause Pal**
    - This is a program where participants are matched as meditation partners and accountability buddies. Over the course of four weeks, participants meditate together on a schedule they choose. The goal is to build a regular meditation habit.
- **Caliro**
    - A custom Android operating system designed to help people use their phones mindfully.

## Blogs

- **Love Yourself Unconditionally**
    - This blog is for long-form content such as essays. I write about a variety of topics, from AI to pornography addiction.
- **Gentle Velocity**
    - This blog is for short-form content where I give regular updates on my productivity and how my day went.

## Learn to Meditate

- If you're looking for guidance on how to meditate, I'm happy to offer some on a purely donation basis :)

Thanks for visiting my site :)

May all beings be happy, healthy, and safe.
